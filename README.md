# INFSCI-2415-INFORMATION-VISUALIZATION

The uploaded files contain two python files and two datasets.

The Stephen Curry Shooting Report.ipynb file is the one that plots scatter plots and heat maps, and the Information Visualization.ipynb file is the one that plots annular bar charts.

The dataset used for the former is Stephen Curry Postseason Stats.csv and for the latter is PbP.BDB.csv.

The combined_image_with_space.png file is the final visualization, and this image stitches the three visualizations together for presentation.
